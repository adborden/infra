# Infra

This repo is an experiment to apply the practices of [Infrastructure as Code][1] to OpenOakland. Why?

* *Inclusivity* - Being transparent in our operations demonstrates a model of inclusivity and enables bottom-up participation.
* *Documentation* - We will have documentation in source code about why infrastructure changes were made.
* *Sustainability* - With better documentation and better participation, we will build a more sustainable organization.

## Setup (macOS)
Prerequisites: [Homebrew][2]

```bash
# 1. Install Terraform
brew install terraform
```
